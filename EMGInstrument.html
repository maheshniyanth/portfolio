            <h3>Electromyography Based Instrument / Rythm Game</h3>
            <img src="" alt="Full View" class="temp">
            <h5  style="margin-top: 50px">Introduction</h5>
            <p>I first saw the surface electromyography sensors used in a prosthetic arm and I was amazed by the functionality that they could provide. Since then I have been interested in doing something with them. I also really love rhythm games, so I came up with a concept for the first audio-only rhythm game using these EMG pads.
            </p>
            <p>I plan of creating a device that works by using several EMGs fitted into a wearable sleeve that goes on the forearm. It detects the movement and position of each of the fingers. It then connects via Bluetooth to a device where the app would allow the user to select the song and calibrate the device.</p>
            <p>The user will know what to do based on varying notes played in the audio indicating what finger to use as well as shorthand standing for a variety of things such as repeating a set note pattern or holding a note.</p>
            <p>The main aspect of this would be its portability. The lack of a screen allows the user to play it discreetly anywhere without looking away from what they are doing. </p>
            <p><strong>This is probably going to be delayed for a while until I receive the backorder of these sensors.</strong></p>
            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p>I knew very little about these sensors other than the fact that they were imprecise at tracking finger movement, so I had a lot of research ahead of me to try and find appropriate ways to interpret the data mostly coming from these papers.</p>
